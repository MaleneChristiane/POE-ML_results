# POE-ML: An automated Pipeline for Optimization and Evaluation of Machine Learning

% SERKAN: Should this below be removed or kept?
% SA: I think we should remove this from here but we can put it on github readme to provide more details about the experimental setup.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item All training datasets should be made before running any model (if they do not already exist), but training different models can happen in parallel. 
% \item Running recursive forecasting needs that the one-step models are trained. To collect the results for a single model, all forecast types and dataset combinations must have undergone the hyperparameter optimization. 
% \item The collected report for the full experiment can only be built after each individual model experiment is completed.
% \end{itemize}
